=head1 Mojocoin::Faucet - Bitcoin Faucet Implementation

Mojocoin::Faucet is a lightweight implementation of a Bitcoin faucet
in Perl. It is built on top of the popular Mojolicious web framework
and uses Redis as an in-memory key/value data store. Mojocoin::Faucet
delegates most bitcoin-related tasks to the original Satoshi bitcoind
client. We use bootstrap from twitter for CSS designs. Here is a wrap
up of the technologies used:

=item bitcoind L<http://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin>

=item Mojolicious L<http://mojolicio.us>

=item Redis L<http://redis.io>

=item Twitter Bootstrap L<http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap>

=head2 Frameworks & Tools

Mojolicious is a cooperative multitasking web framework as it runs on
a single-process event loop (usually L<EV>). You can leverage the
power of GNU/Linux pre-forking using the built-in Hypnotoad web
server.

Mojolicious is an asynchronous web framework. The programming style is
mostly callback-oriented. You install listeners on the event loop and
provide callbacks for specifying your program continuations. This
shouldn't been too alien if you have some javascript or node.js
background. 

To make asynchronous programming easier with Mojolicious, we designed
the L<Continuum|http://github.com/ciphermonk/Continuum> framework. It
allows us to run asynchronous commands in parallel and provide
merge-point callbacks very easily.  This should be fairly simple to
understand: 

    use Continuum;
    use Continuum::BitcoinRPC # $bitcoin
    use Continuum::Redis # $redis
    
    $bitcoin->GetBalance
        ->merge( $bitcoin->ValidateAddress( $address ) )
        ->merge( $redis->hget( ip => value ) )
        ->then( sub { 
            my ( $balance, $validation, $ip ) = @_;
            # This callback is called once all 3 asynchronous
            # operations above are completed
        });

To communicate with the Satoshi Bitcoin implementation, I wrote
L<Continuum::BitcoinRPC|http://github.com/ciphermonk/Continuum-BitcoinRPC>.
It is a simple JSON/RPC interface to bitcoind.

=head2 Installation

Upgrade to Perl v5.14 if you haven't already. This program requires some
features that are only well supported from that version.

You will need the following Perl modules from github:

=over

=item *
L<Continuum|http://github.com/ciphermonk/Continuum>

=item *
L<Continuum::BitcoinRPC|http://github.com/ciphermonk/Continuum-BitcoinRPC>

=item *
L<Continuum::Redis|http://github.com/ciphermonk/Continuum-Redis>

=item *
L<anyevent-jsonrpc-perl|http://github.com/ciphermonk/anyevent-jsonrpc-perl>
This is a fork from L<AnyEvent::JSONRPC::HTTP::Client> fixing a small
issue with error handling in the HTTP client. We only use the HTTP
client from this package.

=item *
L<Mojocoin::Faucet|http://github.com/ciphermonk/Mojocoin-Faucet> (this
project)

=back

And I<at least> the following modules from CPAN:

=over

=item *
L<Mojolicious>

=item *
L<AnyEvent>

=item *
L<EV> (recommended event loop library)

=item * 
L<Mojo::Redis>

=item *
L<GD::Barcode>

=back

You may be missing upstream dependencies from CPAN.  Just install them as you
go.

You'll need to install bitcoind and configure it to use RPC:

L<bitcoin.org|http://bitcoin.org>

The Faucet needs some configuration settings in the file mojocoin-faucet.conf
at the root directory of the application.

    # mojocoin-faucet.conf
    {
        secret => 'sew5Greugoas',
        redis => {
            url => '127.0.0.1:6379',
        },
        bitcoin => {
            url => 'http://127.0.0.1:18332',
            username => 'test',
            password => 'bunBem6Okno',
            account => 'Mojocoin Faucet',
        },
    };

Finally, install L<Redis.io|http://redis.io> and make it available on
the localhost interface, port 6379 (default port). If you change the
Redis network settings, you'll need to update the Faucet.pm file. 

To launch the server, use the following commands from the project root:

=head4 Development

morbo script/mojocoin-faucet.pl -l http://127.0.0.1:3000

=head4 Production (single process)

script/mojocoin-faucet.pl daemon -l http://*:80

You can use Hypnotoad for a prefork Unix-optimized server, Although it has not
been tested with the faucet yet.  The default Mojolicious server should be
enough since the application is optimized for asynchronous IO.

=head2 Bugs

Please report any bugs in the projects bug tracker:

L<http://github.com/ciphermonk/Mojocoin-Faucet/issues>

You can also submit a patch.

=head2 Contributing

We're glad you want to contribute! It's simple:

=over

=item * 
Fork Mojocoin::Faucet

=item *
Create a branch C<git checkout -b my_branch>

=item *
Commit your changes C<git commit -am 'comments'>

=item *
Push the branch C<git push origin my_branch>
